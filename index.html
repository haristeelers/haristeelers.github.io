         <h1>Lebron James</h1>
         <p>The reigning NBA Most Valuable Player has rewritten the team’s record book in his seven seasons. Since becoming the No. 1 overall draft choice out of St. Vincent St. Mary High School in 2003, James has become the team’s all-time leader in points, scoring average, field goals made and attempted, free throws made and attempted, 3-point field goals attempted and steals — and there is, no doubt, more to come.

Every night, he is likely to do something magnificent. When he was drafted, he said he said Cleveland would light up like Las Vegas, and he has done his best to make sure that’s the case.

The team’s meteoric rise from oblivion to elite powerhouse is directly attributable to James.</p>

         <h1>Kyrie Irving</h1>
         <p>Kyrie Andrew Irving (/ˈkaɪriː/, born March 23, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Irving was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, but grew up in West Orange, New Jersey. He played college basketball for Duke University before being selected with the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Cavaliers. Irving has achieved a number of accolades, including the 2011–12 NBA Rookie of the Year, 2014 NBA All-Star Game MVP, and an NBA championship in 2016.[1] He has also played for the United States national team, with whom he has won gold at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.</p>

<h1>Mark Price</h1>
<p>Price was the catalyst for the great Cavalier teams that had the misfortune of coming along at the same time as Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls.

He was the quintessential point guard, directing traffic while nailing open shots and free throws.

The four-time All-Star and first Cav to make first-team All-NBA, he remains the team’s all-time leader in assists and 3-point field goals made. He is the NBA’s all-time free-throw percentage leader in the regular season (.904) and playoffs (.944.)</p>
